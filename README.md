# Used-phones-tablets-price-prediction
## Overview
This was my "first academic project" completed as part of my master's program in Statistics.
The project was carried out in a team of four members, where I contributed primarily to data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing tasks.This project allowed me to learn and practice how to apply machine learning and statistical techniques effectively on real-world datasets.
This project is hosted on GitHub to showcase my learning journey and practical application of machine learning and statistical techniques on real-world datasets. It reflects my growing skills in data analytics and my commitment to continuous learning through collaborative academic work.

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the price of used mobile phones and tablets based on their specifications and usage history using machine learning models.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle (Used Phones and Tablets Price Prediction Dataset)

## Techniques
* Data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model training and evaluation using algorithms like Linear Regression,SVM and Random Forest
* Visualization of results with matplotlib and seaborn

## Libraries & Tools
* Data Processing: pandas, numpy
* Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
* Machine Learning: scikit-learn, SVM
* Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Best Model: Linear Regression

Achieved the highest RÂ² score (~0.79), indicating a strong linear relationship between device features and the used price.
